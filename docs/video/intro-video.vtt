We all get those emails, but we shouldn't have to.&nbsp;
Our data should be handled the same way we store&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.760
our most valuable assets: in a security box,&nbsp;
with a unique key within the vault of a bank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.840
where access to each box is vetted by a security&nbsp;
guard who identifies who you are and records every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.640
access in a journal. Well those are the same core&nbsp;
principles of a zero trust data vault and Caveau&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.840
is a new open source project that will raise the&nbsp;
bar for online security practices when handling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.280
sensitive data. Caveau uses a deductive AI to&nbsp;
scan both APIs and databases to identify sensitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.840
information and segregate it into the Zero&nbsp;
Trust Vault. Data access is validated by our AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.600
and anomalies are traced to eliminate accidental&nbsp;
or willful exposure, while also permanently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.720
shielding the data from its initial collection&nbsp;
through transit and storage. Caveau makes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.040
easy to comply with a long list of regulations&nbsp;
like GDPR, once implemented the continuous audit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.560
functionality provides consumers and regulatory&nbsp;
bodies with real-time proof that the data remains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.800
secure. Caveau is offered via commercial cloud&nbsp;
services and is portable for on-premises solutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.240
like a government national cloud, including a&nbsp;
direct offering via the Open Source tier through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.840
basic to enterprise class. You can specify your&nbsp;
own encryption keys or algorithms to comply with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.480
industry standards or beyond into post-quantum&nbsp;
cryptography. Get in touch with us now!
